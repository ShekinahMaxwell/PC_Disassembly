<p>
Disconnect the power supply cable from the motherboard (typically it's the large 24 pin cable). If applicable -- remove the extra 4 pin ATX power connector from the motherboard (typically it runs from the power supply to give more power to the board.

Remove any Adapter cards (This PC doesn't seem to have any). We are now ready to remove the power supply. Remove any screws holding the power supply into the case. This PC requires me to then slide the power supply off a tab.
